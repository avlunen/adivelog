# ADivelog
This is a customized version of JDivelog (https://sourceforge.net/projects/jdivelog/). Development of JDivelog seems to have ceased, and I found it had somebugs and could need with a feature update.

This is in an early stage, and I am not sure how much time I will have to work on this. On the other hand, the main motivation to create this spin-off was that I wanted a dive log app that is less over-blown than others, such as Subsurface, but nice, small and simple.

In this initial release (call it an alpha version), I have fixed some bugs of JDivelog. I also removed the dive planner/deco module from it; personally, I find some "hobby" deco planners questionable, and there are many others out there. Instead, I have replaced it with a mapping feature; which means you can now create a map with your dive sites, provided you have added coordinates to your list of dive sites.

The mapping module is done with JxBrowser (https://jxbrowser.support.teamdev.com/support/home), you need to download the JAR files from there, as they are to big to include them here.
